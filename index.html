            paragraphs.

            In writing, the words point and purpose are almost synonymous. Your point is your purpose, and how you
            decide to make your point clear to your reader is also your purpose. Writers have a point and a purpose for
            every paragraph that they create.

            Writers write descriptive paragraphs because their purpose is to describe something. Their point is that
            something is beautiful or disgusting or strangely intriguing. Writers write persuasive and argument
            paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or convince someone. Their point is that their reader should
            see things a particular way and possibly take action on that new way of seeing things. Writers write
            paragraphs of comparison because the comparison will make their point clear to their readers.
